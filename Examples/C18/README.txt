PIC18 disassembly examples.

These below folders contain a sample PIC18 program (written in C) compiled using legacy Microchip C18 compiler.
The 'main.c' contained in 'PIC18/' folder was compiled for PIC18F1220 in traditional execution mode, resulting in the binary IntelHEX image 'PIC18Legacy.hex'.
The 'main.c' contained in 'PIC18Extd/' folder was compiled for PIC18F1230 in extended execution mode, resulting in the binary IntelHEX image 'PIC18EggExtd.hex'.

For both folders:

The files 'DisasmMPLAB_raw.txt' and 'DisasmMPLAB_symb.txt' contain the disassembly views as generated by MPLAB IDE integrated disassembler (without/with some 'symbolic' info).

The file 'DisasmREKO_symb.txt' contains the desired final disassembly listing of the IntelHEX file.
The aim is to provided as much as possible symbolic labels/names as well as allowing user-defined identifiers (variables, branch labels, ...).
And more specifically, reko should be able to provide the actual SFR registers names (and bits?) using the PIC XML definition file.
